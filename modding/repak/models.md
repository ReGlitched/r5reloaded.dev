# Models

### MDL Assets

This asset type is used to define 3D models (RMDL) within the RPak. These models can be static or dynamic, and they may include animations and physics files. Models are typically loaded into the game by their file paths and can be used as props, characters, or other interactive elements.

```
{
    "_type": "mdl_",
    "_path": "mdl/props/kralstest/thisisa_testprop.rmdl",
    "$animrigs": [
        "animrig/props/prowler_hatch_tt/prowler_hatch_tt.rrig"
    ],
    "$sequences": [
        "animseq/props/prowler_hatch_tt/close.rseq",
        "animseq/props/prowler_hatch_tt/close_idle.rseq",
        "animseq/props/prowler_hatch_tt/open.rseq",
        "animseq/props/prowler_hatch_tt/open_idle.rseq",
        "animseq/props/prowler_hatch_tt/prowler_hatch_tt/prop_bloodhoundTT_hatch_spawn.rseq"
    ]
}
```

Key Fields:

_type: Asset type, always set to "mdl_" for model assets.\
\_path: Path to the model file within the game assets (e.g., mdl/props/kralstest/thisisa\_testprop.rmdl).\
$animrigs: An array of paths to the animation rigs associated with the model. These rigs define how the model will animate (e.g., animrig/props/prowler\_hatch\_tt/prowler\_hatch\_tt.rrig).\
$sequences: Optional array of paths to animation sequences for the model. If a model doesnâ€™t have an animation rig but still requires animations, these sequences can be applied directly to the model. Sequences included within the model doesn't require to be added seperately aka RePak will auto add them.

Important Notes:\
Materials: Every material used by the model must be included in the main rpak json. Missing materials may result in GUID errors.\
Physics Files: If the model is interactive or needs physics behavior, make sure to include the associated .phy file.
